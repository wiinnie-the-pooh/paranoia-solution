Introduction
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"pyFoam-testing" defines special environment and set of referenced test cases to 
be run to make sure that corresponding pyFoam defintion is ready to use and does not 
contains any regressions. The underlining technology for the non-regression code 
verification is simple:

  1. Run one of the OpenFOAM C++ solvers on corresponding test-case

  2. Run corresponding Python defined analog

  3. Compare produced output results (textually, with help of 'diff' utility)

Note: "pyFoam-testing" environment can perform non-regression test analysis for whatever 
OpenFOAM pyFoam is compiled.

Installation
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See the INSTALL file for more information about configuring of "pyFoam-testing" 
environment.


#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before start to use "pyFoam-testing" it is necessary to source the generated "bashrc" file

There are two main ways to use "pyFoam-testing" functionality, namely:

  - Run the complete set of test cases

    ${PYFOAM_TESTING_DIR}/cases/run

  - Run a given test-case for the current OpenFOAM version

    ${PYFOAM_TESTING_DIR}/cases/r${which_open_foam}/basic/potentialFoam/cylinder/Allrun
